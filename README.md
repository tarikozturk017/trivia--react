## Future Goals

This project can be used to answer question, however it can still be improved by adding new features. These include but are not limited to:
- Membership system can be created and based on user's scores, leadership board can be added.
- Settings can be added, and difficulty level can be managed.
- 'Question round' can be adde, which users get one question every time they answer correctly. At the end the longest row will be the winner.
